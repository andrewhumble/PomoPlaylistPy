## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

Though Cirillo went on to write a 130-page book on the method, its biggest strength is its simplicity:
1. Get a to-do list and a timer.
2. Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.
3. When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.
4. Then enjoy a five-minute break.
5. After three "pomodoros," take a longer, more restorative 10 minute break.

## Combining this concept with music

PomoPlaylist takes a given a Spotify playlist and searches the contained tracks to construct a Pomodoro timer with work sessions of a requested length. A traditional timer contains 25 minute sessions with 5 minute breaks followed by a longer 10 minute break after 3 work sessions. However, specific lengths of work session, break sessions, and long break sessions can be customized according to the user's preferences. 

Structurnig your work periods in this manner provides several benefits, including:
1. More focus and concentration.
2. Subconcious formation of thoughts and ideas during breaks, as your brain is given time to process the information it is taknig in.
3. Less stress.
4. Better management of the interruptions.
5. Keeping high motivation levels.
6. Reinforcing the determination in order to achieve something.
7. Better awareness of the time you need to get things done.

With this, PomoPlaylist makes using the powerful Pomodoro Technique simple by synchronizing your progress with the music you love, leading to more efficient work sessions that maximize concentration and prevent burnout.
